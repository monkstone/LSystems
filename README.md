LSystems Library for Processing-3.4

Mostly just works requires building:

```bash
mvn package # builds the jar
mvn javadoc:javadoc # generates the javadoc as a site
bash createLibrary.sh # generates a tar file lsystems.tgz
```
Alternatively you could use the wrapped maven commands

```bash
./mvnw package # linux or MacOS
./mvnw.cmd package # windows
```

The lsystems.jar gets built into target folder copy to your processing-3.4 `libraries/lsystems/library`

I just can't get on with prisoner johns template, and anyway he's got the wrong link for processing api...............

More examples to come

Install as you would other libraries
