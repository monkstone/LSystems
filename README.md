LSystems Library for Processing-3.0

Mostly just works requires building:

```bash
mvn package # builds the jar
mvn javadoc:javadoc # generates the javadoc as a site
bash createLibrary.sh # generates a tar file lsystems.tgz
```

The lsystems.jar gets built into target folder copy to your processing-3.0 `libraries/lsystems/library`

I just can't get on with prisoner johns template, and anyway he's got the wrong link for processing api...............

More examples to come

Install as you would other libraries
