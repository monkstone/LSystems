# LSystems ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/monkstone/LSystems.svg)
LSystems Library for Processing-3.0

Mostly just works requires building:

```bash
mvn package # builds the jar
mvn javadoc:javadoc # generates the javadoc as a site
```

The lsystems.jar gets built into target folder copy to your processing-3.0 `libraries/lsystems/library`

I just can't get on with prisoner johns template...............
