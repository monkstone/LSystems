Ideally you will have maven-3.6.0 installed (or you could use say netbeans9.0) to compile the library.

The build uses processing artefacts from maven so you don't have to `install those`/`or add them` to your `classpath`.

On linux you could use the build script to build library components, otherwise just to a manual install.
